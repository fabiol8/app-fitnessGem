## 📊 Migration Statistics

### Before (Monolithic)
- **Files**: 1 massive App.jsx file (37K+ tokens)
- **Architecture**: Monolithic, everything in one file
- **Maintainability**: Very difficult to maintain and extend
- **Scalability**: Poor, hard to add new features
- **Testing**: Nearly impossible to test individual components

### After (Modular)
- **Files**: 50+ organized, focused files
- **Architecture**: Domain-Driven Design with feature modules
- **Maintainability**: High, each component has single responsibility
- **Scalability**: Excellent, easy to add new features and screens
- **Testing**: Each component can be tested independently
